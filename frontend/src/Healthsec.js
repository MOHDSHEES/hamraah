          {/* <br /> */}
          <ShowMoreText>
            Hamraah foundation conducts educational sessions on general health
            awareness stressing on the importance of knowledge about general
            health. A lot of people are made to take part in this awareness
            session. Doctors from the surrounding hospitals are called to
            address the people and give talks about human health and its
            importance. People coming from financially low profile background
            are offered free health check-ups and professional advice. There are
            many Government and Non Government organisations which work towards
            the eradication of malnutrition of infants and children,
            representatives from these organisations are invited to the event
            where they are asked to speak about the importance of general health
            awareness. It’s pretty much a necessity that people prioritise their
            health, but very often due to lack of awareness they might end up
            overlooking many symptoms and changes in their body which may later
            lead to disastrous health disorders. To prevent this from happening,
            people should have some minimal amount to health awareness. People
            who work in chemical factories and industries are educated about
            occupational diseases and how they need to take precautionary
            measures while working. Stress is laid on the necessity of having a
            balanced diet and regularly exercising in order to keep the body
            well maintained and achieve physical, mental and social well-being.

          <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "500 " }}>World Aids Day :</h3>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <ShowMoreText>
            World AIDS Day is celebrated on the 1st of December every year. This
            international day is dedicated to raising awareness about this
            disease called AIDS caused by HIV virus. On this day many
            non-government organisations, public health officials and even many
            individuals take initiative to spread awareness about AIDS. AIDS
            which stands short for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is caused
            by the virus HIV (human immunodeficiency syndrome), where the immune
            system of the body deteriorates and eventually causes death. It is
            one of the most deadly diseases in the history of mankind for which
            no cure has been found till date. Though early diagnosis at the
            initial stages can turn out to be helpful. Hamraah foundation
            celebrates World AIDS Day where people especially from the slum
            areas are made to gather and take part in awareness sessions. They
            are given information about the sources by which HIV virus is
            transmitted, the symptoms of AIDS and also about the various HIV
            detection tests performed in hospitals. Emphasis is laid on getting
            general health check-ups done at least once a year to see if they
            are positive for HIV or not (and also to know the probability of
            them getting other diseases). Sometimes it so happens that a person
            who had been infected with HIV virus may not develop AIDS even in
            the later stages of his life, so if a person is found to be HIV
            positive, he can be treated so that he never gets AIDS at all
            (though the person will still remain HIV positive). In a country
            like India where superstitions and blind beliefs rule over science
            and facts, HIV positive people very often are treated as outcasts in
            the society. This leads them to go through a lot of psychological
            trauma. To avoid situations like these, Hamraah foundation considers
            it necessary to educate people about the ways through which HIV will
            not or cannot spread. It’s important for people in the society to
            have a broad mind set.

          {/* <br /> */}
          <ShowMoreText>
            International No tobacco day is celebrated every year on 31st May.
            The main objective of celebration is to ensure abstinence of
            consumption of tobacco or any tobacco products for period of 24
            hours all around the globe. Many countries organise programs to
            educate people about all the drawbacks of tobacco consumption.
            Hamraah foundation celebrates No Tobacco Day wherein people of the
            society are made aware of the hazards of tobacco consumption. Talks
            are given about lung cancer and all other cancers that are caused
            due to tobacco consumption. It’s very important for people to know
            that smoking affects not only the active smoker but also the passive
            smoker, so if a person is found smoking, he is not only risking his
            health but also but simultaneously posing a threat to all the people
            living around him. Tobacco consumption can sometimes turn into an
            addiction which probably takes years to get rid of and sometimes
            even a lifetime. Hamraah Foundation helps people suffering from
            addiction to enrol themselves in rehabilitation centres where they
            can undergo treatment and come back clean. Nicotine tests are
            conducted to check the nicotine level in a person’s body before
            prescribing them with medicines. People especially in the rural
            areas are not aware of the ill-effects of tobacco consumption, as a
            reason of which they resort to tobacco consumption sometimes even at
            a very young age. The events and the programs conducted by the
            Society mainly focuses on the urban slums and rural section of the
            society to make sure that they are well aware of the harmful effects
            of tobacco consumption. The main aim of organising this event is to
            make this world a better place by convincing people to look after
            themselves and promote health awareness.

          <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "500 " }}> World Cancer Day:</h3>
          {/* <br /> */}
          <ShowMoreText>
            World cancer day is celebrated every year on the 4th of February to
            raise awareness about cancer and help in its detection, treatment
            and its prevention. Cancer can be categorized as a group of diseases
            which is caused by the abnormal growth of cells. This abnormal
            growth of cells leads to the formation of lumps or masses of tissues
            called tumor (except in cases like leukaemia where cancer prohibits
            normal function by abnormal cell division in the blood stream and
            also leucoedema where blisters filled with whitish-grey mucous are
            formed on the skin). The primary goal of World Cancer Day is to
            significantly reduce the illness and the deaths caused by cancer.
            Many a times due to lack of knowledge people tend to ignore the
            symptoms which may later turn out to be extremely fatal. Cancer if
            diagnosed at an early stage can be quite helpful as the treatment
            can be started off right away. Today the number of people suffering
            from cancer has exponentially increased due to various reasons such
            as global warming, mutations, and sometimes even unhealthy dietary
            habits. It’s important for people to know about these things so that
            they can avoid uneventful health disasters. Cervical cancer and
            ovarian cancer are the two most widely suffered cancers among Indian
            women. Educating them about menstrual hygiene will serve a great
            deal in preventing them from suffering in the future. Hamraah
            Foundation celebrates World Cancer Day to impart knowledge about
            cancer, its types, symptoms, diagnosis and also its treatment.
            Beneficiaries Participating in this event are educated about how
            they can prevent cancer by following a healthy diet and by
            cultivating healthy habits. Sessions are conducted for women sharing
            knowledge about different types of breast cancer and the necessity
            to have a mammogram done atleast once a year. On the whole the main
            aim of this event is to make sure that people are given enough
            information about this disease which will eventually help them in
            preventing it.
