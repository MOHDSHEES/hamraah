              “Cookies” are small amounts of data that a website can send to a
              web browser on a visitor’s computer. The cookie is stored on a
              visitor’s computer. A cookie may enable the site holder to track
              how a visitor navigates through its site and the areas in which
              they show interest. This is similar to a traffic report: it tracks
              trends and behaviours, but does not identify individuals.
              Information gathered may include date and time of visits, pages
              viewed, time spent at the site, and the site visited just before
              and just after the HAMRAAH FOUNDATION site.{" "}

              </li>
              <li>
                Persistent cookies may be used in some cases, for example, to
                recognize when a visitor returns to a website. The web browser
                will send the cookie information from the initial visit back to
                the website. This is useful to the visitor if he or she has
                established a password at a particular website and wants to be
                identified by that site to perform a function or transaction.{" "}

              HAMRAAH FOUNDATION takes the utmost care to process donations as
              per the instructions given by our donors, online and offline.
              However, in case of an unlikely event of an erroneous donation or
              if the donor would like to cancel his donation, HAMRAAH FOUNDATION
              will respond to the donor within 7 working days of receiving a
              valid request for refund from the donor. The timely refund of the
              donation will depend upon the type of credit card/banking
              instrument used during the transaction. The donor will have to
              send HAMRAAH FOUNDATION a written request for a refund within 2
              days of making the donation to HAMRAAH FOUNDATION’s official
              address or email info.hamraah@gmail.com along with:

                  the donor, the donor will have to return the original receipt
                  to us at our office addresses.{" "}

                <li>
                  If the tax exemption certificate is already issued, then we
                  are sorry but we will not be able to refund the donation.
                  However, in case of a valid refund request due to any error on
                  HAMRAAH FOUNDATION’s part, HAMRAAH FOUNDATION will refund the
                  donation and bear the costs of the same.
