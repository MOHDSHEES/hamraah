          <ShowMoreText>
            {/* <br /> */}
            International Earth day is an annual event celebrated on the 22nd of
            April every year. Over the last few decades the condition of our
            environment has degraded drastically due to increased global
            warming, deforestation, industrial pollutions, testing of nuclear
            weapons and various other reasons leading to a lot of complications.
            The events conducted on the International Earth Day addresses issues
            a like these tries to find a solution to the problems. Hamraah
            foundation celebrates International Earth Day which is supported and
            funded by Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India. A series
            of events and lectures are organized by the foundation wherein
            hundreds of students from many small towns and districts are invited
            to participate. The power of a nation lies its youth, and educating
            young students about problems like these would give us a hope of a
            promising future. The activities conducted, which are symbolic in
            nature raise awareness among the students and also spread the
            message of nature conservation and focus on environmental issues
            that our earth faces. The main objective of celebrating Earth Day is
            to create awareness on sustainable use of natural resources and to
            retain these resources for our future generations. Every individual
            needs to realize that it their responsibility to work together and
            make this world a better place to live A sense of responsibility is
            inculcated through this activity within the participants. Children
            are our future leaders and caretakers of the society at large. As
            they grow, it is most important to make them aware so that they
            evolve into mature adults with clear vision and take appropriate
            decisions in order to make the most judicious use of the earth’s
            natural resources for a sustainable future.

            International Ozone Day Celebration
          </h3>
          <ShowMoreText>
            {/* <br /> */}
            International Ozone day is celebrated every year on the 16th of
            September. It is seen as an international day of call for the
            protection and preservation of ozone layer. It was introduced by two
            French physicists, Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson. British
            meteorologist G.M.B. Dabson developed the world’s first spectrometer
            which could measure stratospheric ozone form the ground. Between
            1928 to 1958 Dobson established a worldwide network of ozone
            monitoring stations which continue to operate to this day. Hamraah
            foundation celebrates World Ozone Day with support by the Ministry
            of Health Sciences, Government of India.Ozone layer is the upper
            layer of the atmosphere which shield the earth from harmful
            ultraviolet radiation and depletion of ozone layer will lead to
            harmful UV rays penetration the earth’s atmosphere and reaching the
            earth’s surface. Excess exposure of UV rays causes a number of
            serious health risks and sometimes even skin cancer and eye
            cataracts. Over the recent past the thickness of the ozone layer has
            considerably reduced and in some places ozone holes have been
            formed. The event focuses on educating people about the ways through
            which they can restore the ozone layer and also how to further
            prevent depletion of the same. They are encouraged to use
            eco-friendly appliances which do not emit greenhouse gases like
            chlorofluorocarbons. The main aim of celebrating Ozone Day is to
            send out a message to every individual that, we as environmental
            stewards need to realize the fact that our planet is in danger and
            we need to protect it from further destruction. Our planet is in
            crises due to global warming, overpopulation and other critical
            environmental issues. Every person on earth shares the
            responsibility to do as much as possible to preserve the planet’s
            finite natural resources for the future generations.

            Workshop on Global Warming and Pollution
          </h3>
          <ShowMoreText>
            {/* <br /> */}
            The society organises workshops on global warming and pollution
            across the states of India. These workshops are supported by the
            Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India. A series of
            lectures and events are conducted followed by competitions where
            children from multiple schools and NGOs participate. The workshop
            provides a great sense of insight about the challenges being faced
            by the whole of humanity. With highlighting these issues the
            workshop makes significant progress about how these issues can be
            addressed. The event creates a sense of belongingness among the
            children towards the environment so that they are well aware about
            all the problems that are faced by humanity. They are convinced and
            made to believe that there cannot be a better tomorrow if they don’t
            take good care of their planet. The application of new technology
            will continue to play an important role in research and development
            which is of crucial importance. Finally progress needs to be made
            with the first and foremost level of individual commitment that
            ‘environment protection begins with me’. The workshop is viewed as a
            catalyst for all the participants to make joint efforts in saving
            the environment. Three primary steps are recommended to be taken to
            meet necessary expectations. Participants should spread their
            workshop learning particularly to their friends, family, neighbors
            and their whole community whenever they get a chance. Secondly
            develop an action plan to formulate joint projects and activities
            that can be undertaken through collaboration between other
            neighboring schools and last but not the least keep steadily working
            on the plan.

            Weather Forecasting Awareness Camps For Farmers
          </h3>
          <ShowMoreText>
            {/* <br /> */}
            Any developing country like ours cannot become developed without the
            development of its rural base. For a country like India, where
            almost sixty percent of the country’s population lives in primitive
            conditions, it becomes even more important. This development is
            possible through technological advancement in the nation. This
            advancement can be channelized to improve scientific literacy as
            well, which is a major obstacle in the path of development.Science
            and technology, especially Earth Science & technology including
            Atmospheric and Meteorological Science & technology etc are being
            used as an effective instrument of growth and change the world over.
            It is being brought into the mainstream of economic planning in the
            sector of agriculture, industry and services. Adoption of improved
            agriculture technology along provision of timely and adequate inputs
            such as rainfall, cyclone, hail storm, dry spell, drought, heat
            wave, cold wave, fertilizer, seeds, pesticides, and all by making
            available affordable agriculture credit/crop insurance, Indian
            farmers are going to ensure food and nutritional security to the
            Nation. An efficient use of available climatic resources, besides
            soil and water resources minimizes the adverse effect and of extreme
            weather and makes benefit of favorable weather. Weather services
            provide a very special kind of inputs to the farmer as advisories
            that can make a tremendous difference to the agriculture production
            by talking the advantage of benevolent weather and minimize the
            adverse impact of malevolent weather. In order to improve the
            understanding of earth science including the same for atmospheric
            science literacy through direct interactions with the rural people
            and the to create awareness about usefulness of weather/climate
            information and other agro met advisory services among the farming
            community, Hamraah Foundations organizes Awareness Camps for Farmers
            in Rural Areas.
