          {/* <br /> */}
          Many parts of the country experience extreme cold during winters which
          makes it difficult for poor children and elderly to survive. People
          live in these areas in extreme poverty, and consequently they have no
          possibility to afford the basic needs, such as shelter, education,
          healthcare and food. Hamraah Foundation organizes free blanket
          distribution camp every year for the poor and marginalized people
          living in slum areas. It is also a meaningful gift for the season. We
          encourage interested people to come forward and donate towards making
          such camps possible and successful. Your gift of blankets will not
          only protect these children and elderly from the vagaries of nature
          but will also keep them warm and comfortable.

            for networking from other areas to encourage them during the event
            to become members of the existing groups or form new ones. They
            Pledge to make more such groups during the programme. Souvenirs were
            presented to President, Secretary and cashier of each SHG groups in
            the end of the programme by the Chief Guest. Top SHGs doing
            exceptional work in their field are awarded with appreciation
            certificates.

          {/* <br /> */}
          <ShowMoreText>
            Hamraah Foundation entered into partnership with GlobalHunt
            Foundation under CSR initiative by Unicharm India’s menstrual
            hygiene project SOFI SAHYOGI. Hamraah Foundation launched the
            project among marginalised women Self Help Groups for sustainable
            livelihood with the partner GlobalHunt Foundation to further the
            menstrual hygiene agenda among the underprivileged women of the
            society. Sofy Sahyogi Project is the community led project designed
            by the Unicharm India Pvt Ltd and GlobalHunt Foundation to sensitize
            the women community on the issue of menstruation. Women over the
            years have developed negligence over menstrual hygiene and
            sanitation. This coupled with lack of basic water and sanitation
            amenities both at the individual and at the community level,
            non-availability of the sanitary products, dependency on male
            counterparts for the purchase of products (especially in semi-urban
            and rural geographies due to restricted mobility) and hesitation
            towards discussing menstruation in public domain have resulted
            towards a lack of formulation of objective regulatory policies and
            practices at social level. Also, among families, distribution of
            income on the purchase of sanitary products especially for women is
            seen as a special benefit than as a special need. Therefore, women
            developed their own practices in respect of usage and disposal which
            poses threats to their own health. To address the serious issue of
            menstrual hygiene Unicharm India CSR initiated a first-of-its-kind
            “Sahyogi” project in Jahangirpuri slums, New Delhi. Hamraah
            Foundations partnered with the GlobalHunt foundation and launched
            the project among ten marginalised women Self Help Groups,
            comprising of 100 women for the awareness, accessibility and
            availability of the sanitary napkins at the same time addressing the
            issue of livelihood of these destitute women. The prime purpose of
            the project was to penetrate in those sectors of communities where
            menstruation and issues related to its hygiene remain unaddressed.
            To address the issue, the project team identified Sahyogis from the
            community who acted as change agents for the community. Through Sofy
            Sahyogi the community gained accessibility to sanitary pads at
            reasonable price whenever required and with time, ceased their
            dependency on the male members. Also, from time to time Sofy Sahyogi
            sensitized women about the issue and provided knowledge on the
            menstrual hygiene management. The Sahyogi project has been able to
            break the gap of community interaction and has created two way
            communications between Unicharm India and local community. The
            Sahyogis were transformed into the key stakeholders to target for
            further dissemination of company’s products through Capacity
            Building & Awareness Sessions.

          {/* <br /> */}
          <ShowMoreText>
            Women empowerment is a process of obtaining equal rights in the
            society for women but sadly women empowerment is something which is
            still not taken seriously in our country. We live in this
            patriarchal setup where the society does not understand the concept
            of freedom and liberation, and would not pave way for innovation.
            It’s very important to educate women so that they know their rights
            and supporting them to stand up against any kind of harassment be it
            at home or outside. Women empowerment also includes encouraging and
            developing skills for self-sufficiency with the focus of eliminating
            the future need for charity or welfare in the individuals of the
            group. Hamraah Foundation organizes vocational training to help
            women coming from financially backward families. Women with no
            proper educational qualifications cannot possibly get secure jobs.
            Hamraah Foundation organises small courses on tailoring and other
            hand-skill workshops so that these women can get into small scale
            industries and make themselves financially stable and support their
            families. The main aim of this programme is to make the women
            efficient enough to produce and market their own garments through
            which they can make a profit and also generate a healthy income
            which will be enough to keep the family going.
