              Training and Learning Resource Centres :

            Based on our Society's objective of providing platform for
            supporting underprivileged children and youth with parallel
            subsidiary classes, library, internet facilities and basic
            assistance in terms of scholarship based on their performance and
            achievement in their academics, professional courses and skills
            training, Hamraah Foundation with support from Indian Minority
            Education Society of Australia has established Hamraah Training and
            Learning Resource Centers in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Delhi. The
            focus of the teaching staff remains on the overall development of
            the pupil through exposure to learning material and regular
            assessments. Significant attention is also paid to bring about
            behavioral changes in order to develop their personality.

            “Though no one can go back in time and change history, anyone can
            make a new beginning from present and transform the future”. In
            India, a large adult population is illiterate. They cannot read or
            write. They are not able to develop their sense of awareness and
            learn about many things around that would help them in life. With a
            view to making these people literate, emphasis has been put on adult
            education. Hamraah Foundation organises various adult education
            programmes especially for aged women who had failed to receive
            elementary education in their childhood. The main objective of the
            programmes is to provide educational options to those adults who
            have lost the opportunity and have crossed the age of formal
            education, but now feel a need for learning of any type, including
            literacy, basic education, skill development etc. Various
            opportunities like reading, writing, increasing awareness levels and
            skills training etc are provided under this programme especially to
            women who were denied formal schooling. Such programmes are
            essential as they not only promote gender equality but also empower
            women to take decisions for themselves and their families. These
            programmes are very effective and often have a dramatic impact not
            only on women participating in this programme but also on adolescent
            children in their families and neighbourhood, as they are also
            encouraged to attend school regularly and decrease the dropout rate.
            It helps people by increasing their standard of living and also has
            the capability to bring mass changes in society. It is rightly said,
            “Books are man’s best friend”. However, books are inaccessible to a
            large number people because of their meagre purchasing power which
            is sometimes perhaps not even sufficient to pay for their basic
            needs like food and shelter. Underprivileged people are denied their
            basic rights and are thus victims of the vicious circle of poverty.
            This vicious circle can be broken by educating these people which
            can be done if books are made accessible to these people. Hamraah
            Foundation believes today’s children are tomorrows leader and hence
            aims at reaching those children who are denied their basic right to
            education due to inability to afford education. Hence, Hamraah
            Foundation organises various book distribution campaigns throughout
            the year to provide free books and stationery to underprivileged
            children. These campaigns are very beneficial for realising the
            sustainable development goal of providing education to all.

            “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change
            the world” Nelson Mandela Hamraah Foundation has been running
            Reaching The Unreached programme has been designed for slow learners
            in the Slum areas where children are often unable to make to schools
            or they dropout early. Reaching The Unreached is an instructional
            programme designed for students in age group of 4 to 13 years who
            have identified deficiencies in reading, writing, and mathematics.
            This programme provides individualized basic skills in the area of
            reading, mathematics and writing. The programme aims the all-round
            development and better academic performance of students in the age
            group of 4 to 13 years whose academic performance is hampered due to
            various factors such as lack of attention/concentration, memorizing
            difficulties, spelling errors, bad hand writing etc. Under this
            programme frequent interaction were made with students and their
            parents. Regular monthly meetings with children and their parents
            are organised with additional home visits. This Non-Formal Education
            model of Hamraah Foundation bridges the gap in education in cases
            where children either have never been to school or have dropped out.
            It also addresses the need of children who are studying in
            government schools, but need additional support at home. There are
            many activities conducted under this programme such as regular
            coaching classes for the children, Individual coaching classes for
            different grade of students, Books distribution for the students
            etc. Individual follow up with the students and their parents is
            ensured to enhance the children participation in extracurricular
            activities. All possible efforts are made to mainstream these
            children in the neighbouring schools.

            Imagine a world without science and technology. No computers, no
            cars. No vaccines or cures for diseases. Wouldn’t life be joyless
            and extremely hard? However, with science on our side, it’s an
            entirely different story. This simply depicts the importance of
            science in our daily lives. We are handicapped without the presence
            of science and technology. Right from the day when man began to eat,
            wear clothes, and light fire, science became an inseparable part of
            life. And since then, several advancements have continuously been
            evolved to make life a little less painful for humankind. The
            world’s become a smaller place to live in. Time and distance have
            been empowered by science. Within a few hours, we are on the other
            side of the globe. The traditional ploughs and bullocks have been
            replaced by tractors making agriculture and cultivation an easier
            process. These are just a few examples that represent the
            significance of science in an individual’s life. No doubt, India has
            progressed to a level to compete other developed nations in
            industrialization, agriculture, science, technology, and
            modernization. On the contrary majority of population are
            illiterates. It is a fact that, every year crores of money is spent
            on education in a view to improve their social and economic
            condition and eventually raise them from below the desired
            illiteracy level. Eminent scientist and Bharat Ratna awardee CNR Rao
            once said “Scientific temper is something we don’t have in our
            country. Science and God have nothing to do with superstition. If
            you are a godly person you don’t do superstition. Actually being
            superstitious is ungodly”. Science not only inculcates the spirit of
            curiosity among the students but helps in developing scientific
            temper. This scientific temper, or scientific attitude is basically
            characterized by the traits like a healthy scepticism, universalism,
            freedom from prejudice or bias, objectivity, open mindedness and
            humility, willingness to suspend judgment without sufficient
            evidence, rationality, perseverance and positive approach to
            failure. Normally, a person having scientific attitude uses the
            method of science in his/her daily life decision making process. Our
            first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru was very fond of using the
            term Scientific Temper and was keen that we should not learn
            sciences superficially’ i.e. just the facts of biology or chemistry
            and physics. He wanted people to possess scientific temper so that
            they could be better scientists, better citizens and capable of
            governing their personal thoughts and actions in a scientific
            manner. Hamraah foundation is active in the field of science
            communication for some years now. The society utilises multiple
            forms of media which are available in the present day for science
            popularization among the masses. The campaigns promote scientific
            attitude and develop scientific temperament among general masses
            especially among youth to create scientific atmosphere in local
            area. Science is promoted as phenomenon which brings about a change
            by bringing out the masses from the darkness of ignorance to light
            of reality. Promoting scientific attitude and develop scientific
            temperament among masses especially among the educationally backward
            interior areas is a challenging task.
