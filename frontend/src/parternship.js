        <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "500 " }}>EVENT SPONSORSHIPS :</h3>
        <br />
        Hamraah Foundation actively takes initiatives to organise various
        workshops and training sessions for women, children as well as the youth
        which are useful since they create awareness amongst the masses about
        the condition of the underprivileged sections of the society. Society is
        ruthlessly pursuing the 2030 agenda of the UNESCO for disseminating
        awareness and importance of SDGâ€™s in our daily lives. Our campaigns
        usually involve self- motivated volunteers who have a strong desire to
        make a difference.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can sponsor our events or workshops and aid us in making a
        difference. Your support will help Hamraah Foundation achieve its goals
        and also make your organisation visible to a greater crowd.
        <br />

        <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "500 " }}>GET INVOLVED :</h3>
        <br />
        Hamraah Foundations offers a wide range of programmes that work for
        children, women and environment. The projects basically aim to improve
        the standard of living of underprivileged people in the country by
        providing them opportunities they are denied. We systematically organise
        various workshops aiming to create awareness and appreciation about SDGs
        and our environment, offer vocational training especially to
        underprivileged women and organise remedial classes for children. The
        projects are stringently monitored by the foundation.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can select any of these projects and become a part of it and thus
        make a difference in the society at large to which we all belong. Your
        little efforts will make us realise the goals of sustainable development
        i.e. development without leaving anyone behind. Together, we can make
        this world a place where everyone enjoys equal opportunities, where no
        one sleeps hungry, everyone has access to education. We can thus create
        a world where everyone has the luxury to design their own lives without
        constraints
